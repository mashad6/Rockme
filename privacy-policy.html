			</div>
			
			<div class="privacy">
				<p>RockMe LLC. ("RockMe," “we,” “us,” “our,” or “Company”​) knows that you care
					about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your

					to you how we collect, use and share personal information from users of our
					website (“​http://www.rockme.info​”), our mobile application (“Application”),
					our hardware device(s) that pair or connect to the Website and/or Application
					(“Product”), and the services we provide via the Website, Application and
					Product (“Services”). This Privacy Policy applies with respect to all
					information we have collected from users of our Website, Application, Product
					and Services, including any information that may have been collected under
					prior privacy policies. We recommend that you read this Privacy Policy in full
					to ensure you are fully informed.</p>
				
				<p>Under the legal purposes of General Data Protection Regulation, EU 2016/679
					(​GDPR​) and the Data Protection Act by the United States of America
					(collectively as “the Acts”), RockMe LLC is set as the Data Controllers of this
					Privacy document and its inherent procedures.</p>

				<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or RockMe data collection,
					use and disclosure practices, please contact the Data Controller, using the
					official email address: ​support@rockme.info​.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="listpirvacy">
				<h1>What Personal Information Does RockMe Collect?</h1>
				<p>The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and
					improve our services, and allows our users to set up a user account and
					profile that can be used to personalize their experience on the Website. We
					collect information from end users of the Website, Application, Product and
					Services in the following ways:</p>
				
			</div>
			
			<div class="listpirvacy">
				<h1>1- INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE:</h1>
				<p>We collect and store any information you voluntarily provide to us. For example:</p>
				<p><strong> ● Account Registration.​ </strong> When you register for an account on our Website or
					Application (“Account”),​, we may ask for your contact information, including
					items such as name, company name, address, email address, username,
					password ​and telephone number ​as part of the registration process.</p>
				<p><strong> ● Payment Information.​ </strong> When you add your financial account information to
					your Account, that information is directed to our third-party payment
					processor. We currently use Apple payment and Google Play Store. We do
					not store your financial account information on our systems; however, we
					have access to, and may retain, subscriber information through our
					third-party payment processor.</p>
				<p><strong>● User Content.​ </strong>You may publicly post content on our Services. In this case,

					viewed and used by other users and third parties we do not control.</p>
				<p><strong>● Communications.​ </strong>If you contact us directly, we may receive additional
					information about you such as your name, email address, phone number,
					the contents of the message and/or attachments you may send us, and any
					other information you may choose to provide. We may also receive a
					confirmation when you open an email from us.</p>	
					<p><strong>● </strong> We also collect other types of information you provide to us voluntarily,
					such as your Product’s version and registration number, and other
					requested information if you contact us via email regarding support for the
					Product and Services.</p>
					<p><strong>● </strong> We also collect any personal information at other points on Services that
						indicate that personal information is being collected.</p>				
			</div>
			
			<div class="listpirvacy">
				<h1>2- INFORMATION WE COLLECT WHEN YOU USE OUR SERVICES:</h1>
				<p><strong> ● Usage of our Services.​ </strong> We receive and store certain types of information automatically when you interact with our Website, Application, Product or Services.</p>
				<p><strong> ● Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.​ </strong> As is true of most websites, we
					may gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. In
					addition, when you use our Services, we may collect certain information
					automatically from your device. This information may include internet
					protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP),
					referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data,
					landing page, and referring URL. To collect this information, a cookie may
					be set on your computer or device when you visit our Services. Cookies
					contain a small amount of information that allows our web servers to
					recognize you. We store information that we collect through cookies, log
					files to record your preferences. We may also automatically collect
					information about your use of features of our Services, about the

					functionality of our Services, frequency of visits, and other information
					related to your interactions with the Services. We may track your use
					across different websites and services. In some countries, including
					countries in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), the information
					referenced above in this paragraph may be considered personal
					information under applicable data protection laws.</p>
			</div>


			<div class="listpirvacy">
				<h1>3- HOW WE USE INFORMATION:</h1>
				<p>General Use. In general, personal information you submit to us is used either

			</div>


			<div class="listpirvacy">
				<h1>4- HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION:</h1>
				<p><strong>●  Shared Access Features. </strong> Our Services may allow users to share
					certain administrative or operative features and functions of their
					Account and Product (“Shared Access Features”) with other users. For
					example, our Services may enable users to share control of their
					RockMe Gadgets and features of the Product with other users.</p>
					<p><strong>●  Vendors and Service Providers.​ </strong>  We may share information with
					third-party vendors and service providers (including Apple App Store
					and Google Play Store) that provide services on our behalf, such as
					helping to provide our Services, for promotional and/or marketing
					purposes, and to provide you with information relevant to you such as
					product announcements, software updates, special offers, or other
					information.</p>
										<p><strong>● Advertising.​ </strong>  We may (now or in the future) work with third-party
					advertising partners to show you ads that we think may interest you.
					These advertising partners may set and access their own cookies, pixel
					tags, and similar technologies on our Services, and they may otherwise
					collect or have access to information about you which they may collect
					over time and across different online services.</p>
										<p><strong>●  Third-Party Partners.​ </strong>  We also share information about users with
					third-party partners in order to receive additional publicly available
					information about you.</p>
										<p><strong>●  Business Transfers.​ </strong>  Information may be disclosed and otherwise
					transferred to any potential acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of

					receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third
					parties as one of our business assets.</p>
										<p><strong>●  As Required By Law and Similar Disclosures.​ </strong>   We may also share
					information to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process,
					or governmental request; (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms
					of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof; (iii)
					detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical
					issues; (iv) respond to your requests; or (v) protect our rights, property

			</div>

			<div class="listpirvacy">
				<h1>5- LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION:</h1>
				<p>Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described
					above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific
					context in which we collect it.</p>
					<p>However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where
					we need the personal information to perform a contract with you; (ii) where
					the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights;
					or (iii) where we have your consent to do so. We have a legitimate interest in
					operating our Services and communicating with you as necessary to provide
					these Services, for example when responding to your queries, improving our
					platform, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or
					preventing illegal activities.</p>
					<p>In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal
					information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to
					protect your vital interests or those of another person.</p>

					<p>If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal
					requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the
					relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal
					information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if
					you do not provide your personal information).</p>

			</div>

			<div class="listpirvacy">
				<h1>6- THIRD-PARTY SERVICES:</h1>
				<p>You may access other third-party services through the Services, for example
				by clicking on links to those third-party services from within the Services. We
				are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these
				third-party services, and we encourage you to carefully review their privacy
				policies.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="listpirvacy">
				<h1>7- SECURITY:</h1>
				<p>RockMe is committed to protecting your information. To do so, we employ a
				variety of security technologies and measures designed to protect
				information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. The measures we
				use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of
				processing your personal information. However, please bear in mind that the
				Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="listpirvacy">
				<h1>8- DATA RETENTION:</h1>
				<p>As requested by the Acts, We retain personal information we collect from you
				where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to
				provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable
				legal, tax, or accounting requirements).
				When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
				information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for
				example, because your personal information has been stored in backup
				archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it
				from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

			</div>


			<div class="listpirvacy">
				<h1>9- ACCESS:</h1>
				<p>As the Acts provides, you have the full right accessing to certain information
				associated with your Account sending as an email. If you terminate your
				Account, any public activity on your Account prior to deletion may remain
				stored on our servers and may remain accessible to the public.</p>
				<p>To protect your privacy and security, we may also take reasonable steps to
				verify your identity before updating or removing your information. The
				information you provide us may be archived or stored periodically by us
				according to backup processes conducted in the ordinary course of business
				for disaster recovery purposes. Your ability to access and correct your
				information may be temporarily limited where access and correction could:
				inhibit RockMe ability to comply with a legal obligation; inhibit RockMe ability
				to investigate, make or defend legal claims; result in disclosure of personal
				information about a third party; or result in breach of a contract or disclosure
				of trade secrets or other proprietary business information belonging to
				RockMe or a third party.</p>

			</div>


			<div class="listpirvacy">
				<h1>10- YOUR DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS UNDER THE ACTS:</h1>
				<p>If you are a resident of the Acts, you have the following data protection rights:</p>
				<p></p>
				<p><strong>● </strong> If you wish to ​access, correct, update, or request deletion​ of your
				personal information, you can do so at any time by emailing us.</p>
				<p><strong>● </strong> In addition, you can ​object to the processing​ of your personal
				information, ask us to ​restrict the processing​ of your personal
				information, or ​request portability​ of your personal information. Again,
				you can exercise these rights by emailing us.</p>
				<p><strong>● </strong> You have the right to ​opt-out of marketing communications​ we send
				you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the
				"unsubscribe" or "opt-out" link in the marketing emails we send you. To
				opt-out of other forms of marketing, please contact us by emailing us.
				● Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information
				with your consent, then you can ​withdraw your consent​ at any
				time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any
				processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the
				processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on
				lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
				<p><strong>● </strong> You have the ​right to complain to a data protection authority​ about our
				collection and use of your personal information. For more information,
				please contact your local data protection authority.</p>
				<p>We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise
				their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection
				laws.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="listpirvacy">
				<h1>11- YOUR CHOICES:</h1>
				<p>You can use some of the features of the Services without registering, thereby
				limiting the type of information that we collect.</p>
				<p>You may unsubscribe from receiving certain promotional emails from us. If
				you wish to do so, simply follow the instructions found at the end of the email.
				Even if you unsubscribe, we may still contact you for informational,
				transactional, account-related, or similar purposes.</p>
				<p>Many browsers have an option for disabling cookies, which may prevent your
				browser from accepting new cookies or enable selective use of cookies.
				Please note that, if you choose not to accept cookies, some features and the
				personalization of our Services may no longer work for you. You will continue
				to receive advertising material but it will not be tailored to your interests.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="listpirvacy">
				<h1>12- CHILDREN'S PRIVACY:</h1>
				<p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under
				the age of 9 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Services. If
				you are under 9, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any
				information about yourself to us. No one under age 9 may provide any
				personal information to us or on the Services. In the event that we learn that
				we have collected personal information from a child under age 9 without
				verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as
				possible. If you believe that we might have any personal information from or
				about a child under 9, please contact us at ​support@rockme.info​.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="listpirvacy">
				<h1>13- CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY:</h1>
				<p>This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time, so please review it
				frequently. Changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted on our websites. If
				we materially change the ways in which we use or share personal information
				previously collected from you through our Services, we will notify you through
				our Services, by email, or other communication.</p>

				<h1>14- INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS:</h1>
				<p>RockMe is a global business. We may transfer personal information to
				countries other than the country in which the data was originally collected.
